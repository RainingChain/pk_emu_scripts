Goal:
  given a setup (lead mon + config)
    cycle range at start for each method

  ex: synchro jolly ->
    [10,44] => method1, mon
    [45, 60] => method2, mon
    [61,99] => method4, mon





Subgoal:
  given a setup, start at cycle = 0
    increment the cycle counter, not caring about vblank.

    cycle=120 when reaching pidlow
    cycle=200 when reaching pidhigh

    method3.push([120-200])

    when call

  start=1000,
